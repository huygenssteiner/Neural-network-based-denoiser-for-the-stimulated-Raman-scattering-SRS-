# Neural-network-based-denoiser-for-the-stimulated-Raman-scattering-SRS-
The Raman spectroscopy is a powerful technique to investigate the features of the matter. The SRS (stimulated Raman spectroscopy) is a nonlinear technique, alternative to conventional Raman, that can be even more powerful, due to the fact that we haven't a loss of information due to the Rayleigh effect. This is in fact less probable. However, the nonlinearity of the interactions between light and matter makes the signal more complex to analize compared to the spontaneous Raman. In this work I tried to implement a neural-network based denoiser inspired by the one at the followed article and github profile:

The main goal is using it to divide the nonlinear contributions by the Raman spectrum.
